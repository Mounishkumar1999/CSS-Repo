        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>Lead singer Dan Reynolds noted that "Natural" is about "finding yourself and being willing and able to stand
            up to whatever adversity comes your way". He said in a press release announcing the song: "Living in a
            dog-eat-dog world can bring out the worst in you, and sometimes, the best. It would be a lie to tell you I
            haven't become somewhat skeptical about some things in the last decade of my life. However, I believe that
            when you truly learn to love yourself, the judging eyes and hateful words become meaningless."</p>
