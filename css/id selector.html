        <p id="tgram">Telegram provides optional end-to-end encrypted chats. Cloud chats and groups are encrypted between the client and the server, so that ISPs and other third-parties on the network cannot access data. Users can send text and voice messages, make voice and video calls, and share an unlimited number of images, documents (2 GB per file), <br>
            user locations, animated stickers, contacts, and audio files. Users can also follow channels.</p>
