    <h1>Elon musk</h1>
    <p>Elon Reeve Musk is a business magnate and investor. Musk is the founder, chairman, CEO and chief technology
        officer of SpaceX, angel investor,
        <br>CEO and product architect of Tesla, Inc., owner and CTO of Twitter, founder of the Boring Company, a
        co-founder of Neuralink and OpenAI, and the president of the Musk Foundation. <br>
        He is the wealthiest person in the world, with an estimated net worth of US$239 billion as of July 2023,
        according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, and $248.8 billion according to Forbes, <br>primarily from his
        ownership stakes in Tesla and SpaceX
    </p>
    
       
    <p>Musk was born in Pretoria, South Africa, and briefly attended the University of Pretoria before moving to Canada
        at age 18,
        <br> acquiring citizenship through his Canadian-born mother. Two years later, he matriculated at Queen's
        University in Kingston, Ontario.<br>
        Musk later transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, and received bachelor's degrees in economics and
        physics there. He moved to California in 1995 to attend Stanford University. However, Musk dropped out after two
        days and, with his brother Kimbal,
        <br> co-founded online city guide software company Zip2. The startup was acquired by Compaq for $307 million in
        1999, and with $12 million of the money he made, that same year Musk co-founded X.com, a direct bank. X.com
        merged with Confinity in 2000 to form PayPal.
