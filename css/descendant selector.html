            <h2>Facebook</h2>
            <p>Facebook can be accessed from devices with Internet connectivity, such as personal computers, tablets and smartphones. After registering, users can create a profile revealing information about themselves. They can post text, photos and multimedia which are shared with any other users who have agreed to be their
                <br> "friend" or, with different privacy settings, publicly.</p>
