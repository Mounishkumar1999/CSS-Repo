        <p>'Lander Module health is normal', says ISRO. “The Lander Module (LM) health is normal. LM successfully underwent a deboosting operation that reduced its orbit to 113 km x 157 km. The second deboosting operation is scheduled for August 20, 2023, around 0200 Hrs.

            Chandrayaan-3 is the third Moon mission by India's space agency ISRO. The goal is to place a lander and rover on the lunar surface and operate them for roughly one lunar day, or 14 Earth days. The small rover, which weighs just 26 kilograms (57 pounds), will fly to the Moon inside the lander.
        
india's Moonshot: Chandrayaan-3 milestone and its final journey to the Moon. India reached a milestone in its ambitious lunar exploration program as the Chandrayaan-3 mission's Vikram lander was successfully separated from the propulsion module, and is expected to land on the lunar surface on August 23, 2023
