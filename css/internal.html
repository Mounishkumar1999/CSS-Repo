    <p>Thor Odinson, sometimes referred to by his title as the God of Thunder, is a fictional character portrayed by
        Chris Hemsworth in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) media franchise, <br>
        based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name and the Norse mythological god of the same name.</p>
    <p class="para">He might seem like a lightweight compared to other superheroes, but Spider-Man has shown he can be stronger than
        Thor - multiple times.<br>
        When it comes to super strength, Spider-Man often ranks fairly low compared to powerhouses like Thor and Hulk.
